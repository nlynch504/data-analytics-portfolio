[4] duration : last contact duration, in seconds (numeric). Important note: this attribute highly affects the output target (e.g., if duration=0 then y='no'). Yet, the duration is not known before a call is performed. Also, after the end of the call y is obviously known. Thus, this input should only be included for benchmark purposes and should be discarded if the intention is to have a realistic predictive model.


[5] campaign
[6] pdays number of days that passed by after the client was last contacted from a previous campaign (numeric; 999 means client was not previously contacted)
